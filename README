 liboping – Library to ping IPv4 and IPv6 hosts in parallel
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
http://verplant.org/liboping/

About
━━━━━

  liboping was inspired by ping, libping and fping: It differs from these
  existing solutions in that it can “ping” multiple hosts in parallel using
  IPv4 or IPv6 transparently. Other design principles were an object oriented
  interface, simplicity and extensibility.

  On top of liboping two command line applications have been built. “oping” is
  a drop-in replacement for ping(1) with very similar output. “noping” is an
  ncurses-based application which displays statistics while pinging and
  highlights aberrant round-trip times.
