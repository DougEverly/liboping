2009-02-17, Version 1.0.0
	* oping.h: Provide the OPING_VERSION to easily determine the library's
	  version at compile time.
	* liboping.c: Fixed an off-by-one error in `ping_iterator_get_info':
	  When determining the buffer size to hold the hostname, the function
	  would return one byte too little.
	* liboping.c: Fix an incorrect assertion in `ping_timeval_add'. Thanks
	  to Alex Brooks for reporting the issue.
	* liboping.c: Make sure `EAI_SYSTEM' is defined at compile time.
	  Although specified by POSIX, Cygwin apparently doesn't have it.
	* liboping.c: Add compatibility code for AIX. Thanks to Doug
	  MacEachern for the patch.
	* liboping.c: Store and possibly return the host name as provided by
	  the user.
	* liboping.c: The number of timed out packets is now counted and can
	  be retrieved with `ping_iterator_get_info'.
	* Perl bindings: The Net::Oping Perl package has been added to
	  bindings/ and is built along with liboping.

2007-03-27, Version 0.3.5
	* liboping.c: Close the filedescriptor in `ping_free', not
	  `ping_host_remove'. Thanks to Esteban Sanchez for submitting this
	  patch.
	* oping.h: Include <sys/types.h> so that `size_t' is defined. Thanks
	  to Alex Brooks for pointing this out.
	* oping.h: Use `extern "C"' when being used with C++. Thanks to Alex
	  Brooks for pointing this out.

2006-12-01, Version 0.3.4
	* Fixes a bug in `ping_host_remove': Due to an incorrect hostname
	  checking the wrong host would be removed.

2006-07-16, Version 0.3.3
	* `sendto(2)' now catches `EHOSTUNREACH' and `ENETUNREACH' if they're
	  defined.

2006-07-13, Version 0.3.2
	* `oping' now drops root privileges as soon as possible.
	* `liboping' now contains an `soname' and a version.

2006-07-09, Version 0.3.1
	* Removed `libltdl' from the distribution since it's not used.
	* More nonsense has been removed from the build system. Thanks to
	  Sebastian Harl for pointing it out :)

2006-07-09, Version 0.3.0
	* The ability to set the source address from which the packets
	  originate has been added to the library and the oping application.

2006-07-16, Version 0.2.3
	* `sendto(2)' now catches `EHOSTUNREACH' and `ENETUNREACH' if they're
	  defined.

2006-06-05, Version 0.2.2
	* The `oping' application didn't exit if no hosts could be resolved.
	  This release fixes it's behavior.

2006-06-01, Version 0.2.1
	* Fix the behavior for non GNU-Linux systems. liboping tried to
	  `bind(2)' to the raw-socket it uses to send ICMP packets. Apparently
	  (decided by majority vote ;) this is not the right thing to do.
	  GNU/Linux never complained about it, but works find without the bind.
	  Other operating systems don't work at all with the bind.
	* Build fixes for non-GNU/Linux platforms: Mac OS X doesn't define
	  `size_t' as `unsigned int' and therefore needs casting and FreeBSD
	  needs to have `sys/types.h' included before `netinet/*.h'

2006-05-29, Version 0.2.0
	* It's now possible to set the data to be send to the remote host and
	  to get the data received from the host.
	* The `oping' binary now calculates the standard deviation. Also, it
	  displays the number of byes that were received and other output
	  changes.
	* Hosts are now returned in the same order as they were added by
	  `ping_host_add'. This is not guaranteed, but makes `oping' prettier.

2006-05-12, Version 0.1.1
	* A bug in the library has been fixed: When the sequence got higher
	  than 2^16 the counter in the packets wrapped around, but the
	  internal counter didn't, causing the library to ignore all further
	  ICMP packets. This affected both, ICMPv4 and ICMPv6.

2006-05-08, Version 0.1.0
	* Initial release.
