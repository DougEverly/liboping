2009-07-27, Version 1.3.2:
	* src/oping.h: Remove `HAVE_*_H' macros for system headers. Those
	  macros should not be used in system wide installed header files.
	  Thanks to Sebastian for fixing this.

2009-07-20, Version 1.3.1
	* src/liboping.c: Fix too eager argument validation that prevented the
	  library to work as documented. Thanks to Sebastian for catching this
	  bug.

2009-07-18, Version 1.3.0
	* oping: Documentation and messages have been improved.
	* oping: Support for the `-D' command line option has been added.
	  Using this new option, the outgoing network device can be set.
	  Thanks to Sebastian Harl for the patch.
	* src/liboping.c: The value of the `received TTL' information after
	  missing packets has been corrected.
	* src/liboping.c: A bug when matching received packets to configured
	  hosts has been fixed. This regression was introduced after 1.0, we
	  believe. Thanks to Sebastian Harl for noticing and fixing this bug.
	* src/liboping.c: Support for the `PING_OPT_DEVICE' option has been
	  added. This option can be used to set the outgoing network device.
	  Thanks to Sebastian for his patch.

2009-07-15, Version 1.2.0
	* `oping': Implement the `-f' command line option to read hostnames
	  from a file (or STDIN).
	* src/liboping.c: No longer export `sstrerror'.

2009-04-05, Version 1.1.2
	* liboping.c: A NULL-pointer dereference has been fixed in the IPv4
	  code. This led to a segmentation fault when an ICMPv4 paket could
	  not be associated with any host. This usually happened when one or
	  more hosts were unreachable for some time. Thanks to Tomasz Pala for
	  discovering the problem and finding a way to reproduce it.

2009-03-23, Version 1.1.1
	* liboping.c: Use libxnet when available. The `normal' version of
	  `recvmsg' does not provide the `auxiliary data' on some or all
	  versions of Solaris.

2009-03-15, Version 1.1.0
	* liboping.c: Eliminate the use of `strerror' and use `strerror_r'
	  instead, removing the (hopefully) last thread-unsafe function.
	* liboping.c: Provide the TTL of received IP packets.
	* oping.c: Allow setting of the TTL using the `-t' command line
	  option.

2009-02-17, Version 1.0.0
	* oping.h: Provide the OPING_VERSION to easily determine the library's
	  version at compile time.
	* liboping.c: Fixed an off-by-one error in `ping_iterator_get_info':
	  When determining the buffer size to hold the hostname, the function
	  would return one byte too little.
	* liboping.c: Fix an incorrect assertion in `ping_timeval_add'. Thanks
	  to Alex Brooks for reporting the issue.
	* liboping.c: Make sure `EAI_SYSTEM' is defined at compile time.
	  Although specified by POSIX, Cygwin apparently doesn't have it.
	* liboping.c: Add compatibility code for AIX. Thanks to Doug
	  MacEachern for the patch.
	* liboping.c: Store and possibly return the host name as provided by
	  the user.
	* liboping.c: The number of timed out packets is now counted and can
	  be retrieved with `ping_iterator_get_info'.
	* Perl bindings: The Net::Oping Perl package has been added to
	  bindings/ and is built along with liboping.

2007-03-27, Version 0.3.5
	* liboping.c: Close the filedescriptor in `ping_free', not
	  `ping_host_remove'. Thanks to Esteban Sanchez for submitting this
	  patch.
	* oping.h: Include <sys/types.h> so that `size_t' is defined. Thanks
	  to Alex Brooks for pointing this out.
	* oping.h: Use `extern "C"' when being used with C++. Thanks to Alex
	  Brooks for pointing this out.

2006-12-01, Version 0.3.4
	* Fixes a bug in `ping_host_remove': Due to an incorrect hostname
	  checking the wrong host would be removed.

2006-07-16, Version 0.3.3
	* `sendto(2)' now catches `EHOSTUNREACH' and `ENETUNREACH' if they're
	  defined.

2006-07-13, Version 0.3.2
	* `oping' now drops root privileges as soon as possible.
	* `liboping' now contains an `soname' and a version.

2006-07-09, Version 0.3.1
	* Removed `libltdl' from the distribution since it's not used.
	* More nonsense has been removed from the build system. Thanks to
	  Sebastian Harl for pointing it out :)

2006-07-09, Version 0.3.0
	* The ability to set the source address from which the packets
	  originate has been added to the library and the oping application.

2006-07-16, Version 0.2.3
	* `sendto(2)' now catches `EHOSTUNREACH' and `ENETUNREACH' if they're
	  defined.

2006-06-05, Version 0.2.2
	* The `oping' application didn't exit if no hosts could be resolved.
	  This release fixes it's behavior.

2006-06-01, Version 0.2.1
	* Fix the behavior for non GNU-Linux systems. liboping tried to
	  `bind(2)' to the raw-socket it uses to send ICMP packets. Apparently
	  (decided by majority vote ;) this is not the right thing to do.
	  GNU/Linux never complained about it, but works find without the bind.
	  Other operating systems don't work at all with the bind.
	* Build fixes for non-GNU/Linux platforms: Mac OS X doesn't define
	  `size_t' as `unsigned int' and therefore needs casting and FreeBSD
	  needs to have `sys/types.h' included before `netinet/*.h'

2006-05-29, Version 0.2.0
	* It's now possible to set the data to be send to the remote host and
	  to get the data received from the host.
	* The `oping' binary now calculates the standard deviation. Also, it
	  displays the number of byes that were received and other output
	  changes.
	* Hosts are now returned in the same order as they were added by
	  `ping_host_add'. This is not guaranteed, but makes `oping' prettier.

2006-05-12, Version 0.1.1
	* A bug in the library has been fixed: When the sequence got higher
	  than 2^16 the counter in the packets wrapped around, but the
	  internal counter didn't, causing the library to ignore all further
	  ICMP packets. This affected both, ICMPv4 and ICMPv6.

2006-05-08, Version 0.1.0
	* Initial release.
