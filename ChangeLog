	* A bug in the library has been fixed: When the sequence got higher
	  than 2^16 the counter in the packets wrapped around, but the
	  internal counter didn't, causing the library to ignore all further
	  ICMP packets. This affected both, ICMPv4 and ICMPv6.

2006-05-08, Version 0.1.0
	* Initial release.
