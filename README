 liboping - Library to ping IPv4 and IPv6 hosts in parallel
============================================================
http://verplant.org/liboping/

About
-----

  liboping was inspired by ping, libping and fping: It differs from these
  existing solutions in that it can `ping' multiple hosts in parallel using
  IPv4 or IPv6 transparently. Other design principles were an object oriented
  interface, simplicity and extensibility.


Features
--------

  * Support for multiple hosts.

  * Support for IPv4 and IPv6.

  * Object oriented interface.

Perl bindings
-------------

  Included in the source package of liboping are bindings for Perl. The code
  resides in the bindings/ subdirectory but is not compiled and installed by
  default. The problem is that before linking with the library, the library
  must be installed.

  If you want to build the Perl bindings compile and install liboping first.
  Then go into the bindings/ directory and type
    $ make perl install
